# PiBot
PiBot is a project aiming to make an autonomous robot. It runs a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and can currently follow a track by detecting the lane edges through a camera, and avoid obstacles. A lot of the code could do with some cleaning up (for example, the plethora of if/elif statements) , which I will hopefully do eventually, but currently I am just trying to get things to work.
